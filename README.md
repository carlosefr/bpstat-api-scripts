# About

The [portuguese central bank](https://www.bportugal.pt) provides an open statistics API at [https://bpstat.bportugal.pt/data/docs/](https://bpstat.bportugal.pt/data/docs/) and this repository contains some scripts that fetch data from it, which can be used as starting points for more elaborate purposes.

This is unofficial example code, written for my own amusement, which may break over time as the API evolves. They're all in Python, which is my programming language of choice.
